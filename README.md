* simple_TS_analysis.ipynb file is implementation of architecture plus.png
* backup_categorizing.ipynb will handle categorizing of a very big dataset which cant fit into ram fully in some kinda efficient way (it made 6 month of process to couple of hours for me)
* backup.ipynb is implementation of learning process on a big dataset (containing pictures) which cant fit into ram fully
* backup_augmented_backup.ipynb is same as backup.ipynb but you can apply pic augmentation on the way too

those learning processes could use some optimization tho
